A fast, minimalist typing test application for the terminal.

## Developed using AI ðŸ¤–

This was developed using Claude Code (with 3.5 Haiku and Sonnet 4) for a grand
total of $15.

Every commit has alongside with it the prompt I used that generated the
contents of the commit (with the exception of commits marked as no ai, but
there was no code that wasn't written by the model).

## Features

- **30-second typing tests** (customizable duration)
- **Real-time WPM tracking** with performance graphs
- **Multiple text sources**: Google top 10k words (default), system dictionary, built-in sample texts, or **code files**
- **Code typing practice** - Load any source code file to practice programming
- **Error correction mode** for accuracy training
- **Visual feedback** with color-coded characters
- **Test history** automatically saved to CSV

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pato/ratatype.git
cd ratatype
cargo build --release
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

```bash
# Basic 30-second test
ratatype

# 60-second test
ratatype -d 60

# Error correction mode (must fix mistakes)
ratatype -c

# Short words only (max 5 characters)
ratatype -m 5

# Use system dictionary words instead of google top 10k
ratatype -s system

# Use built-in sample texts
ratatype -s builtin

# Practice typing code from a file
ratatype -s program.ml

# Combine options
ratatype -d 120 -c -s system -m 4
```

## Command Line Options

- `-d, --duration <SECONDS>` - Test duration (default: 30)
- `-c, --require-correction` - Must correct errors before proceeding
- `-s, --text-source <SOURCE>` - Text source: google (top 10k words, default), system (/usr/share/dict/words), builtin (sample texts), or path to a code file
- `-m, --max-word-length <LENGTH>` - Maximum word length for dictionary mode (default: 7)

## Code Typing Mode

When using a code file as the text source:
- The application extracts functions and meaningful code sections
- Code structure and formatting are preserved (no word randomization)
- Sections are selected randomly to keep practice varied
- **Full newline support** - press Enter to match line breaks in code
- **Smart indentation** - automatically skips leading whitespace, cursor starts at first meaningful character
- Multi-line display with proper code formatting
- Leading whitespace shown dimmed to maintain visual structure
- Supports multiple programming languages (Rust, Python, JavaScript, Go, OCaml, Java, C#, etc.)

## Color Coding

- **Green**: Correctly typed characters
- **Dimmed Green**: Auto-skipped leading whitespace (code mode only)
- **Orange**: Corrected characters (had errors but fixed)
- **Red**: Wrong characters (normal mode only)
- **White**: Current cursor position
- **Gray**: Untyped characters

## History

Test results are automatically saved to `~/.ratatype_history.csv` with:
- Timestamp, duration, WPM stats, accuracy, errors
- Test settings (correction mode, text source, etc.)

## Controls

- **Type** to take the test
- **Backspace** to correct mistakes
- **Enter** to match newlines in code mode, or restart after test completion
- **ESC** to quit

## Requirements

- Rust 1.70+
- Terminal with color support
- `/usr/share/dict/words` file (for dictionary mode)
