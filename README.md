# Ratatype

A fast, minimalist typing test application for the terminal.

## Developed using AI ðŸ¤–

This was developed using Claude Code (with 3.5 Haiku and Sonnet 4) for a grand
total of $15.

Every commit has alongside with it the prompt I used that generated the
contents of the commit (with the exception of commits marked as no ai, but
there was no code that wasn't written by the model).

     Total duration (API):  47m 58.7s

     Total code changes:    1080 lines added, 234 lines removed
     Token usage by model:

## Features

- **30-second typing tests** (customizable duration)
- **Real-time WPM tracking** with performance graphs
- **Multiple text sources**: Google top 10k words (default), system dictionary, or built-in sample texts
- **Error correction mode** for accuracy training
- **Visual feedback** with color-coded characters
- **Test history** automatically saved to CSV

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pato/ratatype.git
cd ratatype
cargo build --release
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

```bash
# Basic 30-second test
ratatype

# 60-second test
ratatype -d 60

# Error correction mode (must fix mistakes)
ratatype -c

# Short words only (max 5 characters)
ratatype -m 5

# Use system dictionary words instead of google top 10k
ratatype -s system

# Use built-in sample texts
ratatype -s builtin

# Combine options
ratatype -d 120 -c -s system -m 4
```

## Command Line Options

- `-d, --duration <SECONDS>` - Test duration (default: 30)
- `-c, --require-correction` - Must correct errors before proceeding
- `-s, --text-source <SOURCE>` - Text source: google (top 10k words, default), system (/usr/share/dict/words), builtin (sample texts)
- `-m, --max-word-length <LENGTH>` - Maximum word length for dictionary mode (default: 7)

## Color Coding

- **Green**: Correctly typed characters
- **Orange**: Corrected characters (had errors but fixed)
- **Red**: Wrong characters (normal mode only)
- **White**: Current cursor position
- **Gray**: Untyped characters

## History

Test results are automatically saved to `~/.ratatype_history.csv` with:
- Timestamp, duration, WPM stats, accuracy, errors
- Test settings (correction mode, text source, etc.)

## Controls

- **Type** to take the test
- **Backspace** to correct mistakes
- **ESC** to quit
- **Enter** to restart after test completion

## Requirements

- Rust 1.70+
- Terminal with color support
- `/usr/share/dict/words` file (for dictionary mode)
